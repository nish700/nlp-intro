### Project Overview

 **About Dataset**

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups.  The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.

The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware / comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale / soc.religion.christian). 

Here is a list of the 20 newsgroups, partitioned (more or less) according to subject matter:

comp.graphics

comp.os.ms-windows.misc

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

comp.sys.mac.hardware

comp.windows.x    

rec.autos

rec.motorcycles

rec.sport.baseball

rec.sport.hockey

sci.crypt

sci.electronics

sci.med

sci.space

misc.forsale    

talk.politics.misc

talk.politics.guns

talk.politics.mideast

talk.religion.misc

alt.atheism

soc.religion.christian


**Following concepts were implemented :**

TfIdf Vectorization

FInding the non-zero component per sample

Classification using Naive Bayes

Finding the top20 words in each category
